This is one of the projects I did while working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.

It was to practice on the following things:
1. Using a navigation bar to link different sections of the web page.
2. Embedding a youtube video you can watch from the page.
3. Using a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page. 
4. Making a page responsive using CSS media queries.
5. Using CSS flexbox.
